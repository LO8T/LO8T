## About Me
Hello, I'm Ali—a mechanical engineer who enjoys technical challenges, occasional desk-smashing frustration 🤦‍♂️, and creative projects. My interests include numerical modeling, vibration analysis, and building anything cool 🛠️.

## Skills & Tools 🚀

Here is a breakdown of my core competencies and the software I use to apply them.

**Engineering & Analysis**
* Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
* Vibration Analysis
* Mechanics of Composite Materials
* Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)

**Software & Tools**
* **MATLAB:** Good working knowledge
* **Abaqus:** Experience with FEA simulations
* **Autodesk Inventor:** Intermediate in 3D design

## Current Project 📚
**Master’s Thesis:**  
Structural health monitoring using vibration analysis.  
I am developing robust, geometry-independent, data-driven methods for defect detection in composite structures as part of my graduate research.  
Goal: Improve reliability and cost-effectiveness in maintaining mechanical structures.

## What I'm Learning 🤓

* **Python:** For engineering computation and data analysis
* **LaTeX:** For improving my technical documentation and report writing
